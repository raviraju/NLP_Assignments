## HW1 : Implement Naive Bayes classifier for a binary text classification task (i.e., spam/ham detection)
Report the following:
* The performance of development data.
* The performance of development data with a model built from only 10% of the training data.
* The performance of development data after trying a different approach to smoothing, common words and/or unknown words.

## HW2 : Implement Perceptron for a binary text classification task (i.e., spam/ham detection)
Report the following:
* The performance of standard perceptron and averaged perceptron on the development data.
* The performance of standard perceptron and averaged perceptron on the development data with models built from only 10% of the training data.

## HW3 : Assign dialogue acts to sequences of utterances in conversations from a corpus using Conditional Random Fields CRF model
* Given a labeled set of data, first create a baseline set of features as specified in assignment description, and measure the accuracy of the CRFsuite model created using those features. 
* Experiment with additional features in an attempt to improve performance. The best set of features developed will be called the advanced feature set. 
* Measure the accuracy of the CRFsuite model created using those features. 
* The last task is assigning dialogue act tags to a set of unlabeled data with two models. The first model uses the baseline feature set and is trained on all the labeled data. The second model uses the advanced feature set and is trained on all the labeled data.
